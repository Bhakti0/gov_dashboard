gov_dashboard — AI Governance Model Prototype

A simple and beginner-friendly AI Governance Prototype that showcases how AI systems can be monitored, evaluated, and controlled to ensure safe and responsible usage.
This project was created as part of an assessment and demonstrates skills in AI safety, governance logic, Python development, and dashboard creation.

✅ Project Overview

This project implements a lightweight AI Governance Framework that includes:

✅ AI Monitoring (logs and checks input prompts)

✅ Risk Assessment (assigns a risk score based on content)

✅ Compliance & Ethical Rule Checking

✅ Governance Decision System:

APPROVE — Safe

REJECT — Unsafe

ESCALATE — Needs human review

✅ Interactive Streamlit Dashboard for demonstration

This system helps illustrate how organizations ensure that AI models behave in a safe, ethical, and responsible manner.

🧠 What This Project Does

When a user enters a prompt into the dashboard:

Monitor:
The system checks for sensitive keywords like password, secret, OTP, etc.

Risk Assessment:
A risk score (0–100) is calculated based on the content.

Compliance Rules:
Ethical and safety rules are applied.

Final Governance Decision:
The system outputs one of the following:

✅ APPROVE

❌ REJECT

⚠️ ESCALATE

This simulates basic AI governance workflows used in real-world AI systems
